# Summer Assignment 2025

## Overview

Hello and welcome to AP Computer Science!  I’m very excited that you’ve signed
up for the class!  In APCS you will continue to improve your coding skills,
learn how to think about code on a deeper level, and enhance your ability to
create things on your computer.

In AP Computer Science we study object-oriented programming (OOP) in detail
using the Java programming language.  Java is part of the C family of
programming languages (C++, Objective C, C#), and the syntax and concepts are
very similar to C/C++.  The Processing language is a simplified version of
Java, with a focus on computer graphics programming.  Processing is an
excellent first language for learning the basic syntax and concepts underlying
Java.  In AP Computer Science we won’t use Processing directly, but we will use
the Processing software libraries to write graphics programs in Java.

## Resources for the Processing language

Processing official website and tutorials page:  
[https://processing.org/](https://processing.org/)    
[https://processing.org/tutorials/](https://processing.org/tutorials/)  

ProcessingExamples page:  
[https://dkessner.github.io/ProcessingExamples](https://dkessner.github.io/ProcessingExamples)

Learning Processing by Daniel Shiffman is a very readable (but non-free) book
on the Processing language.

## Prerequisites

You should be familiar with the following concepts before starting AP
Computer Science:

* variables
* functions
* conditionals (if)
* loops (for, while)
* classes and objects

These concepts are covered in Chapters 1-8 of Learning Processing.  You
don’t need to be an expert in using classes and objects (Chapter 8).
However, you should be able to recognize a class declaration and
understand how to use objects in a program.  The summer assignment is
meant to keep your skills sharp, to refresh your memory about
Processing/Java syntax, and to start or continue thinking about classes
and objects.

These concepts are also illustrated in the examples on the
[ProcessingExamples](https://dkessner.github.io/ProcessingExamples/)
webpage.  You should make sure that you understand all the basic
examples, and especially the Object Oriented Programming examples
(Classes 1/2/3).


## Demo programs

<a href="../hello_objects/hello_objects.pde">hello_objects.pde</a>  
a demo program that illustrates how to declare a class and how to create and
use objects of that class

<a href="../hello_objects_arraylist/hello_objects_arraylist.pde">hello_objects_arraylist.pde</a>  
a demo program that illustrates the use of `ArrayList`, which allows you to
create lots of objects without using a separate variable for each one (this
part is optional -- see assignment below)

You also may want to refer to these examples from our Computer Programming
classes (especially the Classes 1, 2, 3 examples):

## Summer assignment

Your assignment is to write a program in Processing.  The program must be an
animation with `setup()` and `draw()` functions (i.e. not just a drawing).  The
program must also declare a class and use objects of that class.   Other than
these two requirements, you have complete freedom to create what you want.  You
will be showing your program to the class during the first week in the Fall.

Your program could be as simple as the `hello_objects` demo, or it can be as
intricate as you like -- be creative!  However, you should not be copy/pasting
code from anywhere.  As you do this assignment, please keep in mind the goals
of the exercise:

* Practice declaring variables, and writing conditionals, loops, and functions.
* Practice debugging code.
* Practice thinking about classes and objects.

Optional (but highly recommended):  For an additional challenge, use an
`ArrayList` to store lots of objects (for example dozens or hundreds of
bouncing balls or asteroids or bugs...).  

If you have any questions as you are working on your program, feel free to
email me.  Have fun!
