# Course Expectations

## Assignments and Grading

You will be given an assignment every week.  The assignment will
include readings and short coding tasks.

Each assignment has an associated quiz.  You can retake any quiz as
many times as you like (subject to the 70%/30% retake weighting).
However, in order to retake a quiz, you must first write up the code
from your original quiz, make sure it runs correctly, and show me.

You will also have at least one larger coding project, which you will
present at STEM + Arts Galleries and/or the Celebration of Innovation.


## Weekly schedule

Once we get into the semester, a typical week will look like:

* 1st class: Code demo for new unit, discussion and work period

* 2nd/3rd class: Work period (coding, quizzes)


## Time commitment

- Put time in your schedule to write code every day.  You should aim
  for 7 hours/week.  I will be giving you as much time as possible
  during class to write code, ~1-2 hours/week.

- Your goal as you approach the week's exercises is to be able to do
  each exercise without hesitation, within (roughly) 5 minutes.  For
  some exercises, the first time you do it might take 20-30 minutes.
  Or you might get stuck and need to look at a solution or ask a friend
  about it.  It is your responsibility revisit the exercise later to
  make sure you can solve it on your own without hesitation.

- You should not need to "study" for the quizzes.  The quizzes are
  meant to assess whether you have absorbed the new concepts and can
  solve new but similar problems.   If you can do each homework
  exercise without hesitation, you will be able to handle the quiz
  problems.

- There are no tests or midterm/final exam in this course, so no week
  will be any more difficult or stressful than any other.  Instead, so
  you should be putting in a strong, sustained effort every week.

- __Use the in-class work periods effectively!__  It is easy to get
  stuck on a problem.  The fastest way to get unstuck is to talk to
  your classmates (or me).  After you've done the exercises, help your
  classmates!  Talking about problems and explaining solutions is a
  great way to solidify your own knowledge.  We're all here to learn
  together.

## Usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Recent advances in AI have resulted in great improvements in AI-based code
generation.  Generated code may be correct, but also may have subtle bugs.
Remember that your goal in this course is for __you__ to improve your coding
skills.  

### Coding Assignments

The coding assignments are for you to practice your skills, and to practice
solving problems.  Your goal is to be able to write a solution to a similar
problem by hand without help.  Give yourself time to struggle with the
solution, ask classmates, or ask me if you are stuck.  You are welcome to use
AI-generated code to help you, but keep your goal in mind.

### Quizzes

You will write your quizzes by hand on paper.  No AI - real intelligence only.

### Project(s)

If you feel that AI will help your project, you are welcome to use it. 

Any use of AI for assignments or projects is subject to the following:

- You must fully document any use of AI code generation.  You may not take
  credit for code that you did not write.

- You are responsible for getting your program to run, including debugging all
  issues.  Remember that debugging your own code is difficult enough; debugging
  AI-generated code can be even more difficult.

- Prefer open source, locally installed AI to 3rd party web services.
  If you do use a 3rd party web service:
    - Be sure not to submit any identifying information
    - Abide by the service's license agreement
    - Abide by Marlborough's Student Technology Responsible Use Policy
