OOP allows the programmer to break up a large piece of software into modular pieces, each of which can be developed independently of the others.  </p> <p>Java is part of the C/C++ family of languages, and its syntax reflects this ancestry.

I\u2019m very excited that you\u2019ve signed up for the class!  In APCS you will continue to improve your coding skills, learn how to think about code on a deeper level, and enhance your ability to create things on your computer.</p> <p>In AP Computer Science we study object-oriented programming (OOP) in detail using the Java programming language.  Java is part of the C family of programming languages (C++, Objective C, C#), and the syntax and concepts are very similar to C/C++.  The Processing language is a simplified version of Java, with a focus on computer graphics programming.  Processing is an excellent first language for learning the basic syntax and concepts underlying Java.  In AP Computer Science we won\u2019t use Processing directly, but we will use the Processing software libraries to write graphics programs in Java.</p>"},{"location":"summer/summer_assignment/#resources-for-the-processing-language","title":"Resources for the Processing language","text":"<p>Processing official website and tutorials page: https://processing.org/ https://processing.org/tutorials/ </p> <p>ProcessingExamples page: https://dkessner.github.io/ProcessingExamples</p> <p>Learning Processing by Daniel Shiffman is a very readable (but non-free) book on the Processing language. http://learningprocessing.com</p>"},{"location":"summer/summer_assignment/#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<p>You should be familiar with the following concepts before starting AP Computer Science:</p> <ul> <li>variables</li> <li>functions</li> <li>conditionals (if)</li> <li>loops (for, while)</li> <li>classes and objects</li> </ul> <p>These concepts are covered in Chapters 1-8 of Learning Processing.  You don\u2019t need to be an expert in using classes and objects (Chapter 8). However, you should be able to recognize a class declaration and understand how to use objects in a program.  The summer assignment is meant to keep your skills sharp, to refresh your memory about Processing/Java syntax, and to start or continue thinking about classes and objects.</p> <p>These concepts are also illustrated in the examples on the ProcessingExamples webpage.
