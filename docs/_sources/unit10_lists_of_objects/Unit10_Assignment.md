# Unit 10 Assignment

## Coding Project

It's time to get started on your coding project.

Please create a new folder for your project in your APCS work folder.  Add one
or two `.java` files with code to get a PApplet running on screen.  Also
include a project management document (text file) in the same folder, or start
a shared doc and share it with me.


### Project Management Document

Your Project Management Document can be a simple text file in your project
folder, or a shared doc -- whatever works for you.  This document is for you to
keep track of everything related to your project, so you can organize it
however you like.  A project management document is useful whether you are
working on a project alone or with collaborators.  I recommend that you include
at least the following:

* __Task List__: List your immediate next steps.  Each task should be relatively
  small (no more than 1 hour of coding), such as "add title screen" or "fix
  glitch that makes player's head fall off".

* __Project Feature List__: List all major features you want to include in your
  program, and prioritize them.

You can also include notes for things like user feedback, potential ideas for
new features, implementation notes, design decisions, or whatever else is
useful to you.

You should plan on updating this document whenever you work on your project.
Every time you sit down to work:

* Make sure your project builds and runs as you expect, before making changes.

* Do the task at the top of your task list.

* Make sure your project builds and runs properly, then check in the changes to
  your repository.

* Re-prioritize your list: add any new tasks, and re-order so your most
  important tasks are at the top of the list.  Periodically look to see where
  you are on your main Project Feature List.

## Code exercises

### Items

a) Write a class Item, representing a single item you can buy at a store.
   You should include:

- private member variables for the name (String) and price (float) of the item
- a constructor that sets these member variables
- public accessor functions for the member variables

b) Write a class ItemCalculator that calculates various things about a list of
Item objects.  Include these functions:

- a function that takes an ArrayList of Item objects as input, and prints the
  names and prices of the items in the list (returns nothing)
- a function that takes an ArrayList of Item objects as input, and returns  
  the average price of the items
- a function that takes an ArrayList of Item objects as input, and returns the
  name of the most expensive Item

c) Write unit tests for all ItemCalculator functions that return a value, to
demonstrate that the functions are working correctly.  These tests can be
written in the ItemCalculator class, or in an external ItemCalculatorTest
class.


### Persons

a) Write a class Person, including:

- private member variables for the person's name (String) and number of pets (int)
- a constructor that sets these member variables
- public accessor functions for the member variables

b) Write a class PersonStats that calculates various things about lists of
Person objects.  Include three functions:

- a function that takes an ArrayList of Person objects, and calculates the average
  number of pets
- a function that takes an ArrayList of Person objects, and returns the name of the
  person with the most pets
- a function that takes an ArrayList of Person objects, and returns an ArrayList
  of Person objects representing those people who have at least 2 pets.

c) Write unit tests for all PersonStats functions that return a value, to
demonstrate that the functions are working correctly.  These tests can be
written in PersonStats, or in an external PersonStatsTest class.
