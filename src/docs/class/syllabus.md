## Course Description

In this course we will dive deeply into object-oriented programming in
the Java language.  While we explore computer science concepts using
Java, these concepts are applicable to all programming languages.  In
addition to building your coding skills through coding assignments, you
will work on a larger software project using the Processing libraries.
Along the way you will gain valuable experience testing and debugging
your code.

## Topics

In this course we will dive deeply into object-oriented programming in the Java
language.  We will explore many programming and computer science concepts:

* data types and variables
* functions
* conditionals
* loops and algorithms
* logical and arithmetic operators
* arrays, ArrayLists
* computer graphics and animation
* classes and objects
* 2D arrays and image processing
* data analysis 
* algorithm analysis
* recursion
