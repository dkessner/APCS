## Coding Bat

Do these five exercises from 
[Coding Bat Warmup 1](http://codingbat.com/java/Warmup-1).

* [diff21](https://codingbat.com/prob/p116624)
* [parrotTrouble](https://codingbat.com/prob/p140449)

* [posNeg](https://codingbat.com/prob/p159227)
* [icyHot](https://codingbat.com/prob/p192082)

Choose two of the above Coding Bat exercises to do a full
implementation with unit tests on your own.  Your class should include
the function, a testing function, and multiple tests in `main()`.

Example: MonkeyTrouble
