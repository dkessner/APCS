## Project

- Start a project management document (see below)

- First Show & Tell end of next week (Fri Jan 16)


## Project management document

Your project management document can be a simple text file in your project
folder, or a shared doc -- whatever works for you.  This document is for you to
keep track of everything related to your project, so you can organize it
however you like.  A project management document is useful whether you are
working on a project alone or with collaborators.  I recommend that you include
at least the following:

* __Task List__: List your immediate next steps.  Each task should be relatively
  small (no more than 1 hour of coding), such as "add title screen" or "fix
  glitch that makes player's head fall off".

* __Project Feature List__: List all major features you want to include in your
  program, and prioritize them.

You can also include notes for things like user feedback, potential ideas for
new features, implementation notes, design decisions, or whatever else is
useful to you.

You should plan on updating this document whenever you work on your project.
Every time you sit down to work:

* Make sure your project builds and runs as you expect, before making changes.

* Do the task at the top of your task list.

* Make sure your project builds and runs properly, then check in the changes to
  your repository.

* Re-prioritize your list: add any new tasks, and re-order so your most
  important tasks are at the top of the list.  Periodically look to see where
  you are on your main Project Feature List.
