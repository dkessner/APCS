# Assignment 1 (Hello, world!)

Quiz 1 next week (and every quiz from now on) will be based on the Coding
Exercises in the assignment.  You will not be quizzed on the readings.  

## Coding Exercises

Quiz 1 will consist of similar coding exercises that you will write out by
hand.  On the quiz you will need to write the body of a given `main` function
(i.e. the code between the braces `{}`).  

At this point, you do _not_ need to be able to write the declaration of
the class (`public class Blah`) or the declaration of the `main` function
(`public static void main(String[] args)`), but you will in the future.

## Reading

On a first reading, you do not need to remember all the details.  You just
need to know how to look up the details when you need them.  As we progress,
I will assume that you have read the assigned chapters, so you may need to go
back to these readings to refresh your memory.  As you write more code, you
will start to internalize the details and you won't have to look up so many
things.
