## Practice numeric conversions

Practice all of these ten possible conversions:

* `decimal <-> binary, octal, hexadecimal`
* `binary <-> octal, hexadecimal`

Quiz 0 will consist of 5 numeric conversions.

Here's a fun way to practice `hex <-> decimal`: Find an RGB color
picker (Processing, Photoshop, Google).  Pick a color.  Look at
the hex values, convert to decimal RGB, and check your work.  Do
the same in reverse.

for more practice.

__Bonus__ Convert 0x29A to decimal.  Remind me to tell you a story about
this.


## Set up your GitHub repository for your classwork

[Follow these instructions](../../setup/github) carefully to create a repository, add me as
a collaborator, and clone it to your computer with GitHub Desktop:


## Practice using the command line 

You won't be tested on stuff related to the command line.  However, you will be
using the command line extensively this year.  Think of your time spent
practicing working on the command line as an investment that will save you time
not only this school year, but any time you do any future work on the computer.

Here is a recommended exercise, but I also encourage you to practice on your own:

* On paper, draw out a directory tree (2-3 levels deep) with some text files in
  various directories.  

* On the command line, create this directory tree.  Look at your directory in
  Finder / Explorer to check your work.

## Practice writing programs

Create a new directory and write the "Hello, world!" programs for both Python
and Java from scratch.  Make modifications to your programs, and re-compile and
run.
