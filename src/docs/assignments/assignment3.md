## Reading

* [Eck Section 2.3.3 (Operations on Strings)](http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c2/s3.html#basics.3.3) 

* Look at the online docs for the 
  [`String` class](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html)
  (i.e. look at the intro, and skim down the list of functions to see what's
  available, find the functions we use in class).

* Look at the online docs for the 
  [`Math` class](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html)
