## Project

It's time to start planning and prototyping your coding project!  

Your project can be any interactive animation or video game using the
Processing libraries.  

Your goals for the week:

* __Start your project!__  Make a folder, and get some code running, even if
  it's just a title screen and a bouncing ball.

* Make sure you understand how to use the Processing libraries in your program.
  In particular, you will need to understand how to write classes that call the
  Processing functions via a PApplet reference.

* Play around with some ideas.
