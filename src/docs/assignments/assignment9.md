## Project

Your project will be a Java program that uses the Processing libraries for
graphics.  You will continue work on this project throughout the second
semester, with regular in-class code reviews (Show & Tell, every 2-3 weeks).
You will present your project at the Celebration of Innovation (Thursday April
30).

Start your project:

- create a folder for your project in your GitHub repository
- decide what you want to create (video game, interactive art, visual novel, ...)
- create your main PApplet class, with at least a title screen
- write down the main features you want to include in your program
- think about how you will organize your code:
    - scenes
    - user interaction (keyboard / mouse)
    - main classes for player, targets, obstacles, etc.

First Show & Tell: Friday Dec 12 / Tuesday Dec 16

Be ready to show your title screen and talk about your plans for the project.
